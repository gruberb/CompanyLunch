A web application to help you with your restaurant decisions.

Written using React, Webpack, ES6 syntax and the Flux architecutre in mind.

### Installation

1. `git clone git@github.com:gruberb/RestaurantRoulette.git`

3. `npm install webpack -g`
4. `npm install`

### Usage

1. `npm run dev`
2. Open a browser and navigate to `localhost:8080`

### Build

To build the app and prepare it for production, navigate to the project directory and run `npm run build`.
This creates a `bin/` folder with an `index.html` and a `bundle.min.js` file. Only those two files are needed to run it on any web server.
